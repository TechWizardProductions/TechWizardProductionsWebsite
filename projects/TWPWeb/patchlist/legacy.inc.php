                This week's Patch is a small implementation of a few simple systems and some more optimizations and little changes. Now you are able to edit your account information after 
                you have registered. Just like you can log out now (no you couldn't before). After you have logged out (or logged in) you will be redirected to the homepage. I also added 
                a little icon in your browser so you won't have that ugly file icon sitting there. And that is it for this week. I'm sorry there haven't been very large updates recently, 
                but my school life is keeping me busy (as always). But don't be afraid! The website is still in development (obviously), I won't abandon you!

                Just a bug-fixing Patch this week as there are a lot of systems in the works behind the scenes. Fixed some website breaking bugs (yes I'm looking at you Log In / Register Page). 
                Also did some adjustments to just finish some little things off. Enjoy!

                    Fixed the incorrect inclusion of the "Register Form". Now you should be able to register again!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed that your password was still looking like text whilst entering it. Now it should all be concealed so your very secure passwords remain ver secure

                <li>
                    Fixed up the way the pages determine whether you are logged in or not. Now should still work (just like it did before) but now it is more logically coded

                <li>
                    Fixed the non-dissappearing message in the contact form. Now you can enter your message without deleting the "Enter your message here." text

                After every major update, there needs to be a minor tweaking Patch. And that is what this is, a minor tweaking Patch. Wherin I am introducing two new things and fixing 
                some tiny, unnoticable bugs that are annoying but not necessarily website-breaking. First new thing is the Account page. Here your Account information will be shown 
                (and later you will be able to edit the information as well). Second thing is the Patch Note Number. It shows how major the Patch is. It will consist out of three numbers, 
                seperated by a period. It will be formatted like this: Overhaul Number . Major Update Number . Minor Update Number. Overhauls will be very big and dramatic updates that will 
                have an enormous impact on the website. Major updates will be new system introducements and large page introducements that have quite an amount of work put in them. Minor 
                updates will be little tweakings and small page introducements. This Patch is a minor update, so for this Patch only the last number will change. With a Patch like last week's 
                will have a number change in the middle. This is the Patch where the number is introduced but the Patch below it will feature a Patch Note Number as this shows the size of the Patch.

                Another week, another Patch! This weeks Patch is mostly background improvements and additions. Right now the Log in is functional. Although it has no use except for 
                getting rid of the registration and log in forms, it is quite a breakthrough as this is the first time the website has used sessions. For the ones who don't knwo what 
                sessions are, sessions are a server-side managed temporary storage of variables made available to every page on the website (in case you didn't know, scripts can't 
                access variables that are not in their script) and is very useful for account management. As said before, logging in does nothing except for removing the forms. 
                As well as adding a log in, I've created a test environment for the website. Due to the DDoS protection on the server, every ip that requests more than 2000 http request 
                on a day will get banned for 24 hours. Let me make this clear: if you normally browse this website, you will <strong>not</strong> get banned as I'm convinced nobody 
                keeps spamming refresh and cycling through all these pages 2000 times. If you are testing however (which is what I do whenever I add or change my website) you go through 
                those 2000 requests quite quickly. That is why I've created the test environment. Only accessible for me, whcih allows me to do all the spamming if I need to. And that's 
                basically it for this Patch. Enjoy the brand new and completely useless log in system!

                This Patch is going to be a short, but important one. Due to my recent time restrictions, I have decided to abandon the "2D Game" project and thus have removed 
                and changed all the pages related to this project. I still want to learn how to create a game sometime (especially the code part) but now is not the time. 
                However I have done something productive as well (don't worry, I won't destroy the whole website. I promise). I have worked on the NL2 park and have completed it. 
                I have spent a lot of time to figure out a way to give a reliable download, without using external sources. Eventually I have figured it our, but it was very 
                time consuming. Then I started to work on the code for the Log In part of the website. It isn't done by a long ways, but I have made a beginning. It isn't visible 
                however and is just background code. Anyway, happy coding day for me. :)

                After a while of working on the core code and not updating the Patch Notes (as there were no visible changes), I am back in business! A new year means a new style Patch Note!
                At least, this year. I won't promise anything for the upcoming years. Now I changed the style of the Patch Notes in order to communicate further with you. Now I can type a whole
                introductory story about the patch and make some cheesy jokes while doing so, how amazing!
