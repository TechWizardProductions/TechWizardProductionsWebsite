            The Fight for Baron Naschor is a No Limits 2 (NL2) park where one coaster will be present: the "Baron Nashor". The coaster is  
            League of Legends inspired and use 3d models and sounds from the game. This is a sort of "test" park for TechWizard in order to become familiar with both 
            the coaster editor and the NL2 scripting. When the park is finished it will be sent to the Dutch YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DavinstylePro">Davincestylegames</a>. 
            When the coaster has been sent to be showcased, it will be made available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0mrx2n721r18dlz/The%20Fight%20for%20Baron%20Nashor.nl2pkg?dl=0">here</a>. <br />

                Unfortunately I was not able to keep track of my progress so I can say that the project is now finished! I did not think I would be able to finish this project so 
                soon. Screenshots will follow very soon, just like the video in which my coaster will be showcased. Anyway <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0mrx2n721r18dlz/The%20Fight%20for%20Baron%20Nashor.nl2pkg?dl=0">here</a> 
                is the download link to download the park and play it yourself!
